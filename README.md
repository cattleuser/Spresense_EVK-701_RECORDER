# Overview
Available in Arduino development environment.
Data logger for Sony's IoT development board SPRESENSE.
The function of this data logger is to write inertia sensor data along with time stamp. Time stamp data is corrected with GPS signal.

# Features
* After creating a new file, Real Time Clock (RTC) is corrected with the GPS signal before data logging.
* Data logging will not start until the RTC is corrected using the GPS signal.
* When the time is corrected, the GPS reception process stops. The GPS reception process will sleep until the next time recording remains accurate within adjustments.
* Acceleratia and pressure data are recorded with 40[ms] time intervals.
* The data is stored in the SD card slot of CXD5602PWBEXT1.
* Compatibility with QZSS Michibiki.
* A new file is created every 30 minutes.
* Does not drive interrupts.
* The acceleration range is Â± 4 [G] and the resolution is 1 [mG].
* The unit of air pressure resolution is 1 [hPa].

# State transition
The software performs state transition.  
The status of LEDs are shown below.

| State | Meaning | LED3 | LED2 | LED1 | LED0 |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| eStateIdle | System idle state | off | off | on | blinking |
| eStateSetup | Setup state | off | on | off | off |
| eStateRenewFile | File update state | off | on | on | blinking |
| eStateGnss | GPS time data correction state | on | off | off | blinking |
| eStateSensor | Sensor data acquisition state | on | off | on | blinking |
| eStateError | Error occurred | on | on | off | hold |
| eStateWriteError | Write error occurred | on | on | on | hold |

# Data format
The data stored on the SD card is in the following format.  

| Format version | Terminal number(*2) | YYYY/MM/DD hh:mm:ss.ss | Serial number | Time interval[ms] | Acc-X[G] | Acc-Y[G] | Acc-Z[G] | Barometric pressure[hPa] |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|

(*1)The meaning of the record. You can edit on the source code.  
(*2)Used when operating multiple terminals at the same time. You can edit on the source code.
